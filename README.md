# Personal-Salesmen
A custom made module for Prestashop (1.6). 

This module let's you assign a customer to a employee. The employee will only see his/her assigned customers, and not any other customer. So if you have customers that often returns to your shop, but should only be managed by one of your employee's and it's private, this is your module!

If you are logged in as the SuperAdmin you can ofcourse see all the customers and employee's. If you are logged as SuperAdmin you can assign the employee to the customers by assigning them in the on the Orders>Personal Salesmen tab.

On the Prestashop forum we also added a download link for 'Personal Mails' its a extending module for Personal Salesmen. It allows you to automaticly send an email to the linked employee upon the order of the customer.
